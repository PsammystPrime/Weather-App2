## Introduction

The Weather App is a single-page application designed to fetch and display weather information dynamically. Users can search for weather forecasts by location, view detailed weather data, and see weather-related GIFs for a more engaging experience. The application also saves and displays recent searches, making it a handy tool for users who frequently check the weather.
